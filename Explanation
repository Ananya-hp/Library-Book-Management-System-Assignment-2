📚Library Book Management System (Python)

🧩Introduction
 A Python console-based Library Book Management System that uses:
 Singly Linked List → to store and manage book records
 Stack (LIFO) → to record and undo issue/return transactions
 The system supports inserting, deleting, issuing, returning, viewing, searching and undoing actions on books.

⚙️ Data Structures Used
Structure/Class    	Purpose
Book(Node)   -  	 Stores single book record in Linked List
BookList     -  	Implements Singly Linked List (insert/delete/search/display)
Transaction	Stores -  one issue/return action with previous status
TransactionStack   - 	Stack to perform Undo of transactions
LibrarySystem	Driver class containing the menu and user operations

📦 Core Functionalities
1. Insert Book – Add a new book with unique Book ID
2. Delete Book – Remove a book using ID
3. Search Book – Find and display a specific book
4. Issue Book – Change status to Issued and store transaction
5. Return Book – Change status to Available and store transaction
6. Undo Transaction – Restore previous status using stack
7. View Transactions – Show all past issue/return actions
8. Display All Books – Show all book records
9. Exit – Exit from program

⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
Operation	         Time Complexity Space Usage
Insert/Delete/Search	 O(n)          	O(n)
Issue/Return	         O(n)         	O(n)
Undo Transaction	  O(1)	        O(m)(stack size)
Display Books            O(n)	          O(1)

🧠 Error Handling / Validations
- Prevents duplicate Book IDs during insert
- Allows only valid numeric Book IDs
- Avoids issuing already issued books
- Avoids returning already available books
- Prevents undo when no transaction exists
- Shows user-friendly messages for invalid actions
